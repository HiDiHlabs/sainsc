What is sainsc?
===================

sainsc (pronounced /ˈsaiəns/) is a segmentation-free analysis tool for spatial
transcriptomics from in situ capture technologies (but also works for
imaging-based technologies).

It is easily integratable with the `scverse <https://github.com/scverse>`_
(i.e. `scanpy` and `squidpy`) by exporting data in
`AnnData <https://anndata.readthedocs.io/>`_ or
`SpatialData <https://spatialdata.scverse.org/>`_ format.
