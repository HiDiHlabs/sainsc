Tutorials
=========

For a comprehensive introduction we recommend having a look at the `Usage guide <../usage.html>`_.

To follow the Tutorials make sure you have ``sainsc`` installed already. Importantly, some
tutorials may require additional dependencies. Pay close attention at the start of each
tutorial whether additional packages must be installed.

The tutorials are available as Jupyter Notebooks which can be downloaded from
GitHub if you want to follow along interactively (see
`here <https://github.com/HiDiHlabs/sainsc/tree/main/docs/source/tutorials>`_).
